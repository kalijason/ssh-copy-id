# SSH-COPY-ID
ssh-copy-id is a bash script installed by default on ubuntu.

This is how you can make it available on OS X and other *NIX:

    sudo curl --silent https://raw.github.com/Zhann/ssh-copy-id/master/ssh-copy-id >> /bin/ssh-copy-id && chmod +x /bin/ssh-copy-id

I haven't wrote this script. I picked this off of the Internets a long time ago.
